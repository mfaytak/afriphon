## Overview

asdf


# Introduction


## Phonetics in language documentation

Another input to phonological analysis

* Important corrective to overuse of areal "averages"




# Ring: prior analysis

## The Ring languages

include a map here

## Kom vowels

Both languages have been analyzed as having vowel systems unremarkable in the Grassfields context: 

* Peripheral vowels with one central non-low vowel
* Either two or three degrees of height

Both have also been analyzed with weird consonant phonotactics

* Extensive CC- clusters, particularly in Kom

## Kom vowels

Previous analysis of Kom has /i e a o u ɨ/

Shultz cite


## $C_1C_2$- in Kom

Disregarding prenasalization:

bz, bv, mz, fs, fv?, v?,
ts, tf, dz, dv, z?, zv,
chf, jv, shf, yv,
kf, gv


## Oku vowels

/i e ɛ a o u ə/ in Oku

Blood cite, Davis cite


## $C_1C_2$- in Oku
likewise:

bv mv?, fv, v?, 
kf, gv,

Otherwise noted:

t(s)ə, d(z)ə, zə?


## Problems

The "ɨ" vowel varies according to whether it is preceded by a fricative

* Stem ɨ is higher and backer when occurring on its own
* Less high and back when it has a consonant before it

acoustic analysis, old Kom data?


## f- in Kom

\<fɨ\> has two readings in Kom which the orthography does not distinguish

* "hoe" actual -fɨ
* "leaf" ffɨ or -fvɨ


## Problems

Acoustic analysis, Oku data?


## Problems

Clusters almost exclusively occur before ɨ

* Oku analysis explicitly claims "labiodentalizing schwa", which is highly stipulative and not well motivated


## Problems

The range of CC clusters is highly unusual for the area

* Though some Beboid languages and Limbum share these tendencies


# Ring: reanalysis


## Frication on vowels

Frication is associated with either the entire vowel (Oku, older Kom speakers) or first half to third of vowel (younger Kom speakers)


## Vowels as "placed"

Possibly LABIAL, CORONAL place in addition to vowel-like features


## CC- as C[+fric]V


## CC- as C[+fric]V

Allows us to explain free cluster phonotactics in Kom as free CV sequencing


## Kom scenario -> Oku scenario

Two major sources of differences between Kom and Oku under this analysis: 

* Oku has simplified CV sequences through assimilation, matching place
* Kom has developed more instances of Cf- and Cv- from Cw- before /a, e/, etc.


## CV assimilation

Kom speakers vary today: 

* Vowel place change: bz\~bv
* Consonant place change: gv\~bv,  

Interestingly parallel to some alternations in nearby, related Babanki

* by, fy \~ bw, fw
* gv- has long since become bv-


## Kom CC[+low]V

Kom's clusters occurring before ɨ are nearly all Cfa, Cva, and seem to be a later secondary development from -w-

* Speakers still vary between -w- and -f- or -v- in certain lexical items 

But: avocado, nosebleed have /bza/ consistently


# Discussion

## Summary

Fricative vowels, not fricative clusters

* Phonetics tell us this is more likely to be the case
* Upcoming articulatory evidence will disambiguate more convincingly


## Improvements

This greatly improves alignment of the languages with their neighbors

Simple (though puzzling) diachronic changes led to their current profile


## Implications

Do phonetics! especially in this area

* The areal "tendency" phonetically probably does not exist
* or, northern grassfields area is quite different from southern
