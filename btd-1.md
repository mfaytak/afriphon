	* Types of measurements

## Overview, part 2

After our break:

* Articulatory data
* Data management
* Using the data
* Open discussion period


# Some assumptions

## Participants

We presume that you are:

* Employed by, or trained at, a university on the African continent (sub-Sahara)
* Researching in a low-resource context
	* External grants are uncommon
	* Institutional support is low
* Familiar with phonetics in theory, but not necessarily in practice


## All of us

Let's assume that we are all committed to:

* Improving empirical coverage of African languages' sound structures
* Building speech data resources for African languages
	* Ethos: "some data is better than no data"
	* Important for future technical development
* Developing capacity for an African phonetics practice
* Doing these in a way which is adapted to local needs and demands


# Why do phonetics?

## Definitions

Instrumental, not relying on impression and transcription of speech sounds

Rather than in the sense of "non-contrastive detail"

* Phonetics may be concerned with *the specific way* a contrast is produced


## Why instrumental phonetics?

* Precision
* Neutrality
* Community use


## Instrumental methods as complement

The aim is not to *displace* impression-based methods, but to *complement* them


## Precision

Not all phonological contrasts can be easily described by the analyst's ear

* Fine vowel contrasts
* Subtle details in tone


## Neutrality

Phonological description filters all presentation of data through the worker's analysis

"Analyzing the analysts" - Hyman


* Instrumental phonetic data provide material for testing hypotheses about phonological structure


## Example of relevance

Small mémoire/MA thesis type example: how would this be useful in the things students have to write

* Prenasalized consonants? /N/ + /C/, or unit /NC/?
* Durational measures for N and C let us test hypotheses about phonological structure
* f0 (pitch) measures may help us determine whether N is a tone-bearing unit


## Community use

Recordings are required for instrumental phonetic work: many incidental benefits

* Speaker community may access the data
	* Literacy development (teaching tools)
	* Technical development (speech resources)
* Community of scientific researchers may access the data
	* New analyses
	* Comparative work


# Acoustic data

## Desired qualities

We always want acoustic speech data to be:

* Sufficiently loud against background noise
* Low in background noise
* Free of echo


## Good recording

example of good recording

* Speaker's voice is much louder than background
* Speakers voice is not *too* loud
* Background is free of avoidable noises
* Relatively little echo


## Poor recording

examples of bad recordings

* Lots of noise (i.e. rain, or goats, or children)

## Poor recording

* Extreme amounts of echo

## Poor recording

* Speaker is *too* loud (clipping)
* But otherwise good

## Required equipment

Not much! Something to make recordings on. All of the following work fine

* Computer 
* Smartphone with recording app
* Hand recorder/memo recorder

A way of transferring files off of the device and storing for future analysis:

* SD card
* USB drive or external drive


## Optional equipment

External microphones can increase the quality of acoustic data by recording less echo and background noise

* Look for **cardioid** or **unidirectional** microphones for recording single speakers
* Recording public events may require an **omnidirectional** microphone

An acoustic baffle reduces echo

* Soft, fluffy objects: blankets, sofas, etc.

A computer to show written materials on for production, if useful

## Good practices

Check levels before recording

* Make a test recording 
* See if there is clipping 
* or if the speaker is too quiet


## Good practices

Avoid echo:

* Use "soft" rooms (soft furniture, carpets, pillows, hanging clothes) to reduce echo
* Avoid "hard" rooms (tile, stone, or cement walls and floors): these produce too much echo
* Record outside (away from roads, animals, and crowds) if no suitable room exists
* Record in the back seat of a car if available

Snap fingers, click tongue, or clap to gauge echo (if it "comes back", it has too much echo)


## Good practices

Avoid background noise

The rule of thumb is: any noise, however quiet to your ears, will be much louder in the recording

* Do not record if you can hear rain on the roof
	* Rain on metal roof will be *extremely loud* in recording
* Stay away from appliances (fans, refrigerators, anything with a small humming motor)
* Keep away from busy roads (loud vehicles will pass by)
* Remove children, chickens, goats, etc. away from recording area if possible

Listen carefully to your surroundings before recording


## Good practices

The speaker also plays a role in maintaining basic recording quality

* Speaker should not touch, thump, or scratch at the microphone (especially if on their person)
* Microphone should not brush against clothes (will cause loud rustling)
* Speaker should avoid making background noises, especially when emphatic
	* Striking their chests
	* Striking the table

# Basic Praat (tutorial)

## Downloading

## Configuration

## Help pages

## A first recording

Let's record ourselves saying "xxx" in whichever language we would like

* Instructions
* "Save and close"

## A note on recording

This is not typical for phonetics research

* Usually we have *many more* repetitions of the phenomenon at issue
* We need this to ensure we can average across enough instances when we come to analysis
	* Human speech production is inherently variable
	* To get at the actual tendency we need to have many examples of the same thing
* We also prefer to work with *multiple speakers* whenever possible


## Objects list

## Saving your recording

as .WAV (the standard format for phonetics work)

## Importing a sound file

Pius sound files


# Understanding the data

## Waveforms

Sound pressure vs. time

* The pressure the sound waves make on the microphone
* We expect any sound signal to *oscillate*

Sometimes this is **periodic** (repeating pattern); other times this is **aperiodic** (no clear pattern)

Sounds produced with a more open mouth are *louder* and have more sound pressure; these are *thicker* on the waveform


## Interpreting waveforms

Durational measures (trivially)

Voicing


## Spectrograms

We can also show the **spectrogram** for our recording

* Breaks down our waveform to give us information about the **sound spectrum**

Spectrograms show time vs. **frequency** vs. sound pressure (color) 

* The darker the region, the more energy there is


## Simple frequency examples

A sine wave which repeats every 440 ms looks like this:

If we add more sine waves it shows us this:

Think of speech as consisting of *many, many* of these


## Interpreting spectrograms

**Vowels** and **approximants** have characteristic striping, horizontally and vertically

* Voicing cycle is visible vertically
* **Formants** are clearly visible horizontally

**Fricatives** have high-frequency or low-frequency noise

* Dark smudges across entire portions of spectrogram
* The further back the fricative, the lower the frequency

**Stops** show an absence of (most) energy followed by a **burst** across the whole spectrum


## Interpreting spectrograms

**Nasals** look somewhat like vowels, with "smudged" formants and less energy (darkness)


# Annotation

## TextGrids

## Interval tiers

## Point tiers

## Example

Pius data


# Exporting data objects

## Picture window

Spectrograms and waveforms can be **drawn** in the picture window

## Drawing

## Painting

## "Garnishing"

## Adding TextGrid annotation

## Saving figures


# Duration

## What is it for?

Duration of segments, subsegments; timing of tones

Laryngeal contrasts (how long is aspiration of stop), gemination, vowel length, etc.


## How to

Get times; log as tabular data (t1, t2, dur)


## Example

Pius data?


# Pitch and intensity

## What are they for?

f0 signals pitch (tone) - all sorts of phenomena

* Downstep, downdrift, pitch reset, lexical tone contrasts, intonation, etc

intensity is useful for a range of properties (cons lenition, stress, etc)


## How to

Turn on "show pitch"; query pitch (f0)

Exactly parallel for intensity


## Drawing figures

f0 and intensity tracks can be added to figures

* Suggest not overlapping, but rather putting above/below
* Annotation with TextGrids like before

# Formants

## What are they for?

Formant frequencies provide **vowel quality** and other contrasts

* F1 inversely relates to height
* F2 inversely relates to backness
* F3 directly relates to retroflexion, etc.

Formant transitions; lateral and nasal quality, etc.


## How to

Turn on "show formants"

Query formant listing


## Formant estimation

Unlike the other measures, formant estimation often requires calibration to individuals

* Speakers with low f0 need different settings compared to speakers with higher f0
* Children (with very high f0) can be especially difficult
* Often, different settings are needed for front and back vowels (especially back rounded vowels)

Adjust ceiling, adjust number of formants


## Formant figures

Formants work best in an F1-F2 plot (which is not made in Praat), but formant tracks can be drawn like any other measure
