# Some assumptions

## Participants

We presume that you are:

* Employed by, or trained at, a university on the African continent (sub-Sahara)
* Researching in a low-resource context
	* External grants are uncommon
	* Institutional support is low
* Familiar with phonetics in theory, but not necessarily in practice

If you are not in this group, we ask that you **prioritize** those in this group for questions and feedback


## All of us

Let's assume that we are all committed to:

* Improving empirical **coverage** of African languages' sound structures
* Building speech data **resources** for African languages
	* Ethos: "some data is better than no data"
	* Important as starting point for technical development
* Developing **capacity** for an African phonetics practice
* Doing these in a way which is adapted to local needs and demands


# Why phonetics?

## Definitions

This workshop is an introduction to **instrumental** phonetics

* Relying on instrumental readouts for analysis
* Not exclusively **impressionistic**: using the ear and transcribing speech sounds

"Phonetic" work may also refer to non-contrastive **subphonemic detail**

* *The specific way* a phonemic contrast is produced
* This is also important here, but we are focusing on instrumental methods


## Why instrumental phonetics?

Several practical advantages over impressionistic approaches

* **Neutrality** in the face of analytical and perceptual bias
* **Precision** and reliability in detecting  contrasts
* **Community use** of the created data


## Neutrality

In impressionistic phonological description, all presentation of data is filtered through the worker's theoretical analysis 

* For example: autosegmental representations often make transcriptions more abstract <span class="cite">Hyman (2014):545</span>

<img src="./assets/media/hyman-theory.png" width="700">

Phonetic recordings allow better testing of hypotheses about phonological structure

* Recordings do not intrinsically involve an analysis, and can be reanalyzed at a later date
* Transcribed data (being analyzed) is much harder to use for this purpose


## Neutrality

Even a trained phonetic ear is prone to making occasional mistakes based on **perceptual bias**

* For example: nasal consonant codas are more often misidentified after non-low vowels <span class="cite">Zee (1981)</span>

<img src="./assets/media/zee.png" width="600">

* Transcription mistakes permanently enter the record


## Precision

Not all contrasts can be easily described by the analyst's ear, especially in the moment 

* Fine vowel contrasts (especially central vowels)
* Diphthongs versus consonant secondary articulation
* Prenasalization versus N+C clusters
* Subtle differences in tone level and contour
* Multiple downsteps/upsteps

Recordings allow for careful listening later


## Community use

Recordings are required for instrumental phonetic work: many incidental benefits

* Speaker community may access the data
	* Literacy development (teaching tools)
	* Technical development (speech resources)
* Community of scientific researchers may access the data
	* New analyses
	* Comparative work
* Analysis may be replicated


## Complementary methods

The aim is not to *displace* impression-based methods, but to *complement* them

* Transcription will always be needed at some level
* Our point is that it should not be *exclusively* relied on as the analytical object
* Whenever possible, transcriptions ought to be supplemented with recordings, visualizations of recordings, or instrumental measures as evidence
* Instrumental measures as "second opinion" for analysis


# Recording acoustic data

## Desired qualities

We always want acoustic speech data to be:

* Low in background **noise**
* Sufficiently **loud** against background noise, but not too loud
* Free of **echo**

Certain details of format are also important: 

* Record using a high **sampling rate**, at least 22.1 kHz
* Save in **non-compressed** format (such as **.WAV**; avoid .MP3)


## Good recording

<audio id="good" src="./assets/media/best-quality.wav"></audio>

Here is an example of a good recording

* <button onclick="document.getElementById('good').play()">"La plume de ma tante"</button>
* Speaker's voice is much louder than background, but is not *too* loud
* Background is free of avoidable noise
* Practically no echo

The following slides contain recordings which fail on one of the points above


## Too noisy

Recordings should not contain excessive background noise 

<audio id="noise2" src="./assets/media/noisy2.wav"></audio>
<audio id="scuff" src="./assets/media/scuffing.wav"></audio>

* <button onclick="document.getElementById('noise2').play()">Continuous noise</button> from a fan
* <button onclick="document.getElementById('scuff').play()">Intermittent noise</button> from touching the microphone

Any noise, however quiet to your ears in the moment, will be much louder in the recording later


## How to improve

Listen carefully to your surroundings, and avoid:

* Rain on the roof (especially metal roofs)
* Appliances (refrigerators, any motors or fans)
* Busy roads (trucks, taxis)
* Chickens, goats, children, etc.

Speaker should also minimize non-speech noise:

* Touching or scratching  microphone, or contacting shirt collar
* Producing background noises when emphatic (striking chest or table, clapping hands)
* Phone ringing or vibrating


## Too much echo

<audio id="echo1" src="./assets/media/echo1.wav"></audio>
<audio id="echo2" src="./assets/media/echo2.wav"></audio>

If echo is strong, speech ends up overlapping itself; problem for listening and analysis later

* <button onclick="document.getElementById('echo1').play()">Slight echo</button> (in tiled hallway)
* <button onclick="document.getElementById('echo2').play()">More echo</button>(in concrete stairwell)

How to improve: listen for echo and choose surroundings which have less

* "Soft" rooms reduce echo (couches, carpets, pillows, hanging clothes); tile, stone, and cement produce echo
* Record in the back seat of a car (motor off) if available
* Record outside if no suitable room exists


## Too loud (clipped)

<audio id="clip" src="./assets/media/clipping.wav"></audio>
<audio id="pop" src="./assets/media/popping.wav"></audio>

If the speaker is too loud and/or too close to the microphone, the device cannot respond enough; **clipping** results

* <button onclick="document.getElementById('clip').play()">Clipping of whole utterance</button>
* This can also happen for <button onclick="document.getElementById('pop').play()"> stops and fricatives only</button>, where the releases "pop" in the microphone


How to improve: make test recordings after you position your microphones

* If there is general clipping, microphone needs to be further away or speaker needs to be quieter
* If stops "pop", position microphone to the side of the mouth
* **Gain** can often be adjusted if you are using a recorder


## Equipment

Not much equipment required: something to make recordings on

* Laptop computer 
* Smartphone with recording app
	* "Awesome Voice Recorder X" (free with ads) is a good app
	* Others must definitely exist
* Hand recorder/memo recorder
* Professional recorder (Zoom H4N, etc)

A way of transferring files off of the device and storing for future analysis:

* SD card
* USB drive or external drive

Headphones, to check recording quality


## Equipment

External microphones can increase the quality of acoustic data by recording less echo and background noise

* Look for **cardioid** or **unidirectional** in the description if you are recording single speakers
* Recording public events may require an **omnidirectional** microphone

An acoustic baffle can reduce echo

* Soft, fluffy objects: blankets, sofas, etc.
* This can also be achieved by selecting the recording setting carefully, and using a cardioid microphone

## Other tips

Do not use computer noise reduction/filtering in general

* Go into your computer's sound settings and *turn this off*; make sure apps (i.e. Zoom) don't have separate filters
* Normal to hear slight "fuzz" in background, or very slight echo

Recording over **Zoom** works surprisingly well, if all else fails <span class="cite">Ge, Mok, & Xiong (2021); Sanker et al (2021)</span>

* Some *small* effects on the recording are noted
* Turn noise cancellation off if using to record (switch to "original sound")
* Better still to use the speaker's phone on their end to record, and use Zoom to supervise the process


# Basic Praat (tutorial)

## Downloading and configuring

Download Praat from <a href="https://fon.hum.uva.nl">fon.hum.uva.nl</a> or <a href="https://praat.org">praat.org</a>

<img src="./assets/media/praat1.png" width="800">

* Mac: the .dmg file contains Praat.app (which you can run immediately) and the option to install
* If you have issues opening, see <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/download_mac.html">2. "How to Start"</a> here
* Windows: the .zip file contains Praat.exe, which you simply double-click to run (instructions <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/download_win.html">here</a> if needed)


## Windows and manual

Both the **object window** (shown below) and **picture window** appear when you open Praat (we'll ignore the picture window for now)

Basic issues can often be solved using the manual

<img src="./assets/media/praat-manual.png" width="400"> <img src="./assets/media/praat-manual-search.png" width="400">

* The manual is also available online <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/Manual.html">here</a>
* Other introductory guides can be found <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manualsByOthers.html">here</a>


## First recording

Let's record ourselves saying a "good day, good afternoon" greeting in whichever language you would like

<img src="./assets/media/praat-record-menu.png" width="400"> <img src="./assets/media/praat-record-console.png" width="400">

* Make sure you "save to list" before closing the recorder!


## Stored sound

You should now have a Sound in your **objects** window

* Select the Sound object and a menu will appear to the right
* Click "Play" to hear your sound

<img src="./assets/media/praat-Sound.png" width="600">


## Saving your recording

We'll end this by saving our work as a .WAV file (the standard format for phonetics work)

* The file is not yet saved, only *stored* in Praat
* If you close Praat without saving the file, it will vanish

<img src="./assets/media/praat-save-Sound.png" width="600">


## Importing a sound file

<audio id="bush" src="./assets/media/bbk-hills-of-bushes.wav"></audio>

We might also **import** sounds which have already been recorded

* Download <a href="./assets/media/bbk-files.zip">this ZIP file</a> (673 KB), which contains all of the files we'll use
* Use the "Open" dialogue to open **bbk-hills-of-bushes.wav**
* That file contains one utterance of Babanki <button onclick="document.getElementById('bush').play()"> [t…ôÃÄtƒÅ≈ã t…ôÃÅ t…ôÃÅÍúút√≥ î]</button> "hills of bushes" <span class="cite">from Faytak & Akumbu (2021)</span>

<img src="./assets/media/praat-import.png" width="600">


# Making and using TextGrids

## Viewing a sound file

We'll start by viewing Babanki <button onclick="document.getElementById('bush').play()"> [t…ôÃÄtƒÅ≈ã t…ôÃÅ t…ôÃÅÍúút√≥ î]</button> "hills of bushes"

* Select the Sound and click "View and Edit" in the right menu
* Note controls (zoom in, zoom out, scroll)
* Select by clicking, SHIFT-clicking, or clicking and dragging in sound
* Press TAB to play, or click bar below window

We lack useful landmarks at this point

* Each "blob" is a syllable
* We may wish to know where the words and segments are
* No indication of tones (yet)

<img src="./assets/media/praat-bbk-open.png" width="700">


## Making a TextGrid

**TextGrids** are one of the most useful features of Praat: annotate and organize your audio files

* Using the menu as shown below, we'll make a TextGrid for our Babanki sound object

<img src="./assets/media/praat-annotate.png" width="400"> <img src="./assets/media/praat-make-tg.png" width="400">


## Interval tiers

Let's use the **interval tier** "sentence" and use it to transcribe the utterance

* Contains a list of ranges in time separated by boundaries
* Useful for marking off words, utterances, and some vowels and consonants
* Here, click before the beginning and after the end of the utterance, then type a transcription or translation in the middle

<img src="./assets/media/praat-bbk-interval.png" width="700">


## Point tiers

Let's use the **point tier** "stop" to mark off where each [t] release happens

* Contains a list of points in time
* Useful for instantaneous events
* Note that *intervals are generally more useful* for most segments
* Can't click and highlight range like interval tier 

<img src="./assets/media/praat-bbk-point.png" width="700">


## Adding and removing tiers

We might be dissatisfied with how the tone marks are displaying; we could make a new tier for tones (autosegmental style)

<img src="./assets/media/praat-bbk-add.png" width="400"> <img src="./assets/media/praat-bbk-add2.png" width="300">

Amending the TextGrid using the new tier:

<img src="./assets/media/praat-bbk-add3.png" width="700">


## Saving TextGrids

Using CTRL+S or the menu shown below, you must *save* your TextGrid when you are done

* If you close Praat without saving your TextGrid, it will vanish
* Much like recorded audio files which are stored in the object list

<img src="./assets/media/praat-tg-save.png" width="700">


# Reading our data

## Data displays

We may wish to provide further details in our TextGrids, but we encounter another problem here: how to interpret the data?

* Praat shows **waveforms** and **spectrograms**
* Note the simpler TextGrid (segments, tones); **bbk-hills-of-bushes.TextGrid** in downloaded files

<img src="./assets/media/praat-bbk-datatypes.png" width="700">


## Waveforms

**Waveforms** show sound pressure (the pressure that sound waves make on the microphone) versus time

* We expect any **voiced** speech signal to *oscillate* because the vocal folds open and close in a repeating pattern
* Other **voiceless** sounds show no movement away from "zero line" and no clear oscillation

<img src="./assets/media/praat-bbk-periodicity.png" width="700">


## Sonority

Sounds produced with a more open mouth are *louder* and  more sonorous <span class="cite">Parker (2008) </span>; these are *thicker* on the waveform

<img src="./assets/media/praat-bbk-sonority.png" width="700">



## Spectrograms

We can also show the **spectrogram** for our recording

* Breaks down our waveform to give us information about the **sound spectrum** and where its energy is (high or low frequency)

Spectrograms are three-dimensional, and show time vs. **frequency** vs. sound pressure (color) 

* The darker the spectrogram (and the thicker the waveform), the more sound pressure there is

<img src="./assets/media/praat-bbk-spectro0.png" width="700">

* Think of it as an elevation map (Mt. Cameroon pictured)

<img src="./assets/media/relief-map.png" width="400">


## Interpreting spectrograms

**Vowels**, **semivowels**, and **approximants** have characteristic striping, horizontally and vertically

* Voicing is visible as vertical stripes in vowels, and as a small "bar" at bottom
* **Formants** are clear horizontal bands above the voicing bar

<img src="./assets/media/praat-bbk-spectro1.png" width="700">


## Interpreting spectrograms

**Nasals** look somewhat like vowels, with "smudged" formants and less energy (darkness)

* Due to the opening of the velum: nasal cavity "muffles" the sound
* Much like soft objects in a room muffle echo

<img src="./assets/media/praat-bbk-spectro2.png" width="700">


## Interpreting spectrograms

**Fricatives** have high-frequency or low-frequency noise

* Dark irregular smudges across entire areas of spectrogram
* The further back the fricative, the lower the average frequency
* Compare [s] and [ í]: [s] is further front, has higher frequency, sits higher on spectrogram

<img src="./assets/media/praat-fricative1.png" width="700">

<img src="./assets/media/praat-fricative2.png" width="700">


## Interpreting spectrograms

**Stops** show an absence of (most) energy followed by a **burst** across the whole spectrum

<img src="./assets/media/praat-bbk-stop1.png" width="700">

**Affricates** look similar, but as if they were followed by a fricative

* From Babanki [k…ôÃÄd íoÃÅm] 'Babanki' <span class="cite">Faytak & Akumbu (2021)</span>

<img src="./assets/media/praat-bbk-stop2.png" width="700">


## Prenasalized segments

Prenasalized stops and affricates often have a *long nasal closure* followed by a *short oral closure* which we can see clearly in the spectrogram

* Note the "smudged" energy goes away when oral closure begins in [‚Åøpf ≤] below
* From Babanki [k…ôÃÄ‚Åøpf ≤…®ÃÅ≈ã] 'owl' <span class="cite">Faytak & Akumbu (2021)</span>

# Drawing figures

## Why make figures?

Figures are an easy way to present a small amount of phonetic data in scientific papers

* Give support to phonological judgments
* Support particular transcriptions
* Provide more detail for any especially unusual sounds or sound contrasts

This section: professional-looking and informative data displays


## Picture window

Waveforms and spectrograms can be "drawn" or "painted" (respectively) in the **picture window**

* This also opened when you open Praat; we'll stop ignoring it now

<img src="./assets/media/praat-picture.png" width="600">


## Drawing a waveform

"Draw" is for any line-based drawings, including waveforms

picture of "draw" menu
picture of option window incl "garnish"


## Result

picture of drawn waveform


## Painting a spectrogram

"Paint" is for other objects (mostly spectrograms)

picture of "paint" menu
picture of option window incl "garnish"


## Result

picture of painted spectrogram


## Adding a TextGrid

TextGrids can be drawn as well, and by default appear with an empty space above them


## Result

(this works with waveforms, too)

spectrogram + textgrid figure


## Adding details

"Garnishing" automatically provides details which may not look totally right: you can add certain details yourself after adding the relevant object, "un-garnished"

* X or Y axis scales and titles
* Titles for plots
* Font, font size, font color, etc.

## Saving

As with everything else in Praat, you must **save** before closing the picture window or you will lose your work

# Measuring phonetic properties

## Why

More than showing the entire sound file as a waveform or spectrogram, referring to specific phonetic properties can be useful

* ... 


## Duration

Duration of segments, subsegments; timing of tones

Laryngeal contrasts (how long is aspiration of stop), gemination, vowel length, etc.


## How to

Get times; log as tabular data (t1, t2, dur)


## Example

Pius data?


## Pitch and intensity

f0 signals pitch (tone) - all sorts of phenomena

* Downstep, downdrift, pitch reset, lexical tone contrasts, intonation, etc

intensity is useful for a range of properties (cons lenition, stress, etc)


## How to

Turn on "show pitch"; query pitch (f0)

Exactly parallel for intensity

Pius examples

* Change defaults to 70-140 Hz to reflect speaker's pitch range


## f0 and intensity figures

f0 and intensity tracks can be added to figures

* Best to put above/below a spectrogram or waveform


## Formant frequencies

Formant frequencies provide **vowel quality** and other contrasts

* F1 inversely relates to height
* F2 inversely relates to backness
* F3 directly relates to retroflexion, etc.

Formant transitions; lateral and nasal quality, etc.


## How to

Turn on "show formants"

Query formant listing


## Formant estimation

Unlike the other measures, formant estimation often requires calibration to individual speakers

* Speakers with low f0 need different settings compared to speakers with higher f0
* Children (with very high f0) can be especially difficult
* Often, different settings are needed for front and back vowels (especially back rounded vowels)

Adjust ceiling, adjust number of formants


## Formant figures

Formants work best in an F1-F2 plot (which is not made in Praat), but formant tracks can be drawn like any other measure
