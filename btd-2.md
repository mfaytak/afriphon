## Overview

In this session:

* Beyond Praat: articulatory data
* Data management
* Using the data
* Open discussion period


# Articulatory data

## Acoustics vs. articulation

Acoustics gives us an **indirect idea** of the movements of the articulators

Sometimes, though, we need to look directly at the articulators

* If there are multiple explanations for acoustics
* If the examined sounds are totally unfamiliar or especially unusual
* In our context, this is fairly common


## Lip articulation

Movement of tongue and lips: lips are easily seen moving

* Mirror at 45 degree angle provides a side view

## Examples

Pius vowel photos

## Palatographs

More complex, but provide information on tongue-palate contact <span class="cite">Anderson (2008)</span>

* stop and fricative place
* certain aspects of vowel articulation

Method

* paint tongue
* one token involving one lingual consonant
* open mouth, insert mirror, photograph

Electropalatography? <span class="cite">Thomas-Vilakati (2010)</span>

## Examples

Kom high vowels (which I will be talking about in my regular talk)

* Kom iz vs. i
* Audio examples

## Required equipment

Smartphone camera or handheld camera

Hand-held mirror (for lips)
dental mirror (for palatography)

edible pigment (chocolate powder, edible charcoal) for palatography


## Optional equipment

Phone tripod or camera tripod, to stabilize image

Photography light for better image quality


## Good practice

Take more photographs than you think you'll need 

* Not all will be well-lit or at the right angle
* ???

## Beyond our reach (for now)

Things which are a bit tricky to measure; stick with acoustics 

* Tongue root advancement or retraction <span class="cite">Allen, Pulleyblank, & Ajíbóyè (2013) </span>

# Data management

## Now what?

Suppose you have made a set of recordings onto your device. Now you should ensure that you don't lose them

* You can skip this part for some amount of time, but you risk losing the data altogether
* Remembering the recordings is not a substitute for the recordings themselves


## File backups

Back up *every file* in multiple locations if possible

* SD cards are an efficient way to do this
* Thumb drives and external drives are acceptable as well (though they wear out with time)
* Multiple computers work (i.e. share with a colleague)

Cloud storage is a good option, though uploading may be expensive

* Emailing small files to yourself works in a pinch
* Long-term cloud storage is ideal (Google Drive, OneDrive, Box, Dropbox, etc)


## File naming

Name your files according to the same logical pattern

* Date, language, topic
* Avoid duplicating names

To identify further details you should speak them during *the recording itself*

* Identify yourself
* Identify speaker if this is not sensitive information
* Give time, date, and location of recording
* Identify anyone else who may be heard in the recording (assistants, translators, etc.)



# Using the data

## Figure/photo production

Your current work will benefit from inclusion of figures, photographic data, etc.

* include as supplementary information or examples in mémoire/thèse MA/PhD model
* Same for papers


## Figure/photo analysis

In exceptional cases, you may measure some physical attribute of articulatory pictures/images and convert that to tabular data

i.e. ratio of lip opening to lip width (or height-height) in pixels

lip example/schematic


## Tabular data analysis

Tabular data consisting of many acoustic measures is more complicated: it needs to be **averaged**, summarized (mean/standard deviation), or submitted to a statistical model

Averaging and basic statistical models can be done on this data, using Excel's Data Analysis Tools (need to install)

* While Excel *works*, learning a dedicated statistical program is better in the long run
* We'll discuss after break

picture example?


## Statistics

Simple statistical analysis and modeling (t-testing, linear models, curve fitting, etc)

* We acknowledge this is not practical for all attendees, but it is standard in phonetics
* Collaborators who happen to know statistics may contribute this work (division of labor)
  * Multi-authored papers *are the norm* in phonetics!
* Having nicely formatted tabular data is crucial to this handoff


## Statistical power

Because of the need to model the data, it's important to have enough **statistical power**

* Need to ensure you have collected numerous repetitions of the phenomenon you're after
* Need to ensure that enough **speakers** are recorded (the more the better)
  * To get at the community average, instead of the idiosyncrasies of one speaker

## Trying stats yourself

R is free software which is useful for statistical analysis

* Excel can also be used (though it's not always so useful)

Simple plots can also be made in Excel and R


# Conclusions

## Summary

Summary asdf


## Open discussion

Some potential topics for discussion:

* How can we build capacity for this work in the continent's universities?
* Can existing high-quality documentary work be used as a starting point?
* How can we valorize this work when students decide to pursue it?
* What should be the role of linguists off the continent in developing this work?
