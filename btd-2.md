## Overview

In this session:

* Articulatory data
* Data management
* Using the data
* Open discussion period

# Articulatory data

## Acoustics vs. articulation

Acoustics gives us an **indirect idea** of the movements of the articulators

Sometimes, we need to look directly at the articulators

* If there are multiple explanations for acoustics
* If the examined sounds are totally unfamiliar or especially unusual
* In our context, this is fairly common


## Lip articulation

Movement of tongue and lips: lips are easily seen moving

* example (Pius again?)
* Mirror at 45 degree angle provides a side view


## Palatographs

More complex, but provide information on tongue-palate contact

* stop and fricative place
* certain aspects of vowel articulation

Method

* paint tongue
* one token involving one lingual consonant
* open mouth, insert mirror, photograph


## Required equipment

Smartphone camera or handheld camera

Hand-held mirror (for lips)
dental mirror (for palatography)

edible pigment (chocolate powder, edible charcoal) for palatography


## Optional equipment

Phone tripod or camera tripod, to stabilize image

Photography light for better image quality


## Good practice

Take more photographs than you think you'll need

# Data management

## Now what?

Suppose you have made a set of recordings onto your device. Now you should ensure that you don't lose them

* You can skip this part for some amount of time, but you risk losing the data altogether
* Remembering the recordings is not a substitute for the recordings themselves


## File backups

Back up *every file* in multiple locations if possible

* SD cards are an efficient way to do this
* Thumb drives are acceptable as well
* Multiple computers work (i.e. share with a colleague)
* Emailing to yourself works in a pinch
* Long-term cloud storage is ideal


## File naming

Name your files according to the same logical pattern

* Date, language, topic
* Avoid duplicating names

To identify further details you should speak them during *the recording itself*

* Identify yourself
* Identify speaker if this is not sensitive information
* Give time, date, and location of recording
* Identify anyone else who may be heard in the recording (assistants, translators, etc.)

## Tabular data

Structure of measures (formants, duration, f0, etc) is important

Store as **tabular data** (csv or txt)

* One observation per row
* One measure per column
* Name columns uniquely using the first row
* One or more columns should provide other required information (speaker's ID, which segment or word the measure is from, experimental condition, etc)


## Software

Manually building the tabular data in Excel is slow but works

Praat **scripting** can more quickly produce tabular data, but this is beyond the scope of this tutorial

* Python and R are also usable for these purposes 
* All three are available free of charge


# Using the data

## Figure/photo uses

Your current work will benefit from inclusion of figures, photographic data, etc.

* include as supplementary information or examples in mémoire/thèse MA/PhD model
* Same for papers


## Tabular data uses

Tabular data is more complicated: it's a lot of text/numbers

* Provide summaries (averages, etc)
* Provide statistical analysis 
  * This is not practical for all attendees, but if working in a collaborative publication your collaborators may be able to provide

## Statistics

Current research in phonetics mainly relies on statistical modeling and inference to argue points

* Because of the need to model the data, it's important to have enough **statistical power**
* Need to ensure you have collected numerous repetitions of the phenomenon you're after
* Need to ensure that enough **speakers** are recorded (the more the better)
  * To get at the community average, instead of the idiosyncrasies of one speaker

## Stats are hard, but...

## Trying stats yourself

R is free software which is useful for statistical analysis

* Excel can also be used (though it's not always so useful)

Simple plots can also be made in Excel and R
