## Overview

In this session:

* Beyond Praat: articulatory data
* Data management
* Using the data
* Open discussion period


# Articulatory data

## Acoustics vs. articulation

Acoustics gives us an **indirect idea** of the movements of the articulators

Sometimes, though, we need to look directly at the articulators

* If there are multiple explanations for acoustics
* If the examined sounds are totally unfamiliar or especially unusual
* In our context, this is fairly common


## Lip articulation

Movement of tongue and lips: lips are easily seen moving

* Mirror at 45 degree angle provides a side view

## Examples

Pius vowel photos

## Palatographs

More complex, but provide information on tongue-palate contact <span class="cite">Anderson (2008)</span>

* stop and fricative place
* certain aspects of vowel articulation

Method

* paint tongue
* one token involving one lingual consonant
* open mouth, insert mirror, photograph

Electropalatography? <span class="cite">Thomas-Vilakati (2010)</span>

## Examples

Kom high vowels (which I will be talking about in my regular talk)

* Kom iz vs. i
* Audio examples

## Equipment

Everything that we've talked about involves **minimal equipment**

* Smartphone camera or point-and-shoot camera
* **Dental mirror**: or hand-held metal mirror, about 6cm wide and 12cm long
  * Held outside for lip angles
  * Inserted against upper molars for palatography
* Edible pigment (chocolate powder, edible charcoal) for palatography

Optional:

* Phone tripod or camera tripod
* Photography lighting


## Good practice

Take more photographs than you think you'll need 

* Not all will be well-lit or at the right angle
* ???


## Figures vs. tabular data

The value of photographic evidence as a figure should be obvious

In exceptional cases, you may measure some physical attribute of articulatory pictures/images and convert that to **tabular data**

* i.e. ratio of lip opening to lip width (or height-height) in pixels
* lip example/schematic


# Practical considerations

## File naming and metadata

Name your recording files according to the same logical pattern

* Date, language, topic
* Avoid duplicating names
* Avoid vague names

To identify further details, speak them during *the recording itself*

* Identify and name yourself
* Identify speaker(s) and their roles if this is not sensitive information
* Identify anyone else who may be heard in the recording (assistants, translators, etc.)
* Give time, date, and location of recording


## File backups

Back up *every recording* in multiple locations if possible, to avoid technological problems destroying your work

* SD cards or thumb drives
* Multiple computers (share key files with a trusted colleague)
* Email small files to yourself (download as attachments later)
* Long-term cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive, Box, Dropbox, etc) is ideal but uploading may be expensive


## Tabular data 

Tabular data consisting of many measures needs to be averaged, summarized (mean/standard deviation), or submitted to a statistical model

Averaging and basic statistical models can be done on this data, using Excel's Data Analysis Tools (need to install)

* While Excel *works*, learning a dedicated statistical program is better in the long run

picture example?


## Statistics

Simple statistical analysis and modeling are standard in phonetics for analysis of numerical data (t-testing, linear models, curve fitting, etc)

* We acknowledge this is not practical for all attendees, but collaborators can help guide this work
* Having nicely formatted tabular data is crucial to this handoff

If you want to try stats yourself, it's best to find software for handling tabular data:

* <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> is free software which is useful for statistical analysis
* Excel can also be used 
* Simple plots can also be made in Excel and R


## Statistical power

Because of the need to model the data, it's important to have enough **statistical power**

* Need to ensure you have collected numerous repetitions of the phenomenon you're after
* Need to ensure that enough **speakers** are recorded (the more the better)
  * To get at the community average, instead of the idiosyncrasies of one speaker


# Conclusions

## Summary

Summary asdf


## Open discussion

Some potential topics for discussion:

* How can we build capacity for this work in the continent's universities?
* Can existing high-quality documentary work be used as a starting point?
* How can we valorize this work when students decide to pursue it?
* What should be the role of linguists off the continent in developing this work?
